Include as much detail as possible to help us quickly understand and address the issue:
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected endpoints or files (e.g., `main.py`, `calcfunc.py`)
- Any logs, proof of concept, or screenshots

We aim to respond to all security reports within 7 days.

## Security Best Practices

- Review code and dependencies for vulnerabilities. See `requirements.txt` for current dependencies.
- Use trusted clients to interact with the API.

## Dependencies

We rely on open-source dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`. Please report any security advisories that affect these dependencies.
